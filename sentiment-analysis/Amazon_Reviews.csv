"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update. This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.",1,

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139,5,"Funny story with this one. My first phone was stolen off my porch so i had to report it stolen and buy another replacement then once i got my replacement phone my son decided it needed a cranberry juice bath before i even had a chance to activated it. So needless to say it was no good anymore. i put in a drawer a year later i took it out and plugged it in to see what would happen and to my surprise it started to charge, and i have been using it ever since. Even after being soaked in juice and not working for forever it is working now and i love it. Absolutely no complaints",0,
