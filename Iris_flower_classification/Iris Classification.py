"""Objective
The aim is to classify Iris flowers among three species from measurements of sepals and petals length and width. The Iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris plany. The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exibits good generalization.</p>
